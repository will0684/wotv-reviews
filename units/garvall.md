\
Garvall is here to blast Evade teams away!\
\
Energist is a new job based on the Magic stat that does both Magic and Missile type damages. The basic attack is ranged Missile type but based on Magic so he'll always be able to do some damage if out of AP.\
All of the moves are instant cast. Being able to do Missile damage will make it harder to defend against him.\
\
The Energist job comes with the new type of passive buff "Hyper-Vitality" that will buff AGI by 30% and MAG/DEX by 60% for the first 5 turns of battle. As 5 turns are often enough to make or break a Guild or Arena battle I recommend using it but if you want something for longer fights you can use his two 30% Magic passives.\
\
Garvall is now the best unit to take out Evade teams thanks to his high range, instant 100% hit, cross AoE "Detonation Blast" move, along with high AGI from "Hyper-Vitality" and good survivability for the task.\
His 5% Slash resist is a starter to make him ready for the job along with his two casts of "Chi Barrier" that reduce physical damage by 50% for 3 hits. If those weren't enough he also has access to the "Hyper-Reactivity" counter a "Reflex" type skill only for Physical hits.\
\
His -10% weakness to magic is easily negated with the "Mage's Protection" passive if you want to be extra careful.\
\
"Twin Chi Rupture" is his strongest move at 245% mod but the close range of two squares AoE and high AP cost can make it harder for the perfect situation for it to come.\
\
Pairing him with the Solidus card and Siren or Diabolos Espers are recommended choices.\
Using him with the Red Mage subjob gives him access to one of the best magic moves in the game, "Jamming Thrust", that will be a menace coming from him, and "Cura" that the AI does use if someone needs healing and there aren't enemies in range. "Cura" can be very handy at the start of a 2nd GW battle to heal allies and get back some AP.\
Kotodama opens up "Nimble Movement" to make it easier to reach those pesky Evaders quickly. "A Heart Like Needles" can be overkill for Garvall but still nice to have.\
\
His limit burst is "Concentrated Chi Lancer", a 200% mod at max, 4 squares straight line in front of him AoE that reduces SPR by 30 and increases SPR Pen by 50.\
\
Due to the high cost at 58 AP I recommend having this off because the Evade units you should be fighting aren't stacking SPR and even a tank like Agrias will take damage from his other skils.\
\
His TMR is the "Peacetime Brooch", an accessory (HP 303, DEF 8, CRIT 8) that at max buff MAG by 40% and Magic Resist Pen by 50%. While it's definitely nice on him you can save on maxing it and use "Kaleido Moon" or "Saint's Circlet" instead. Again, remember Evade units can't stack much magic resist. As an example,  with the Fenrir card Ruin Sterne is only neutral to Magic making the Pen from this TMR useless against him.
His synergy with Dark units is quite good despite being the only Magic user for now. His Magic stat can reach 1000 (Diabolos, maxed weapon, maxed Soul of Thamasa) even without a card so he won't get in the way of the Physical cards Dark units need and is a 
natural pair for the Shiva card, so common in Dark Evade teams. Once Black Rose Helena arrives the two will be a deadly duo that can combine forces to take down UR Mont and Ex WoL.\
\
Lastly, although Garvall doesn't have EX yet his potential to reach high Magic and good HP will make him able to compete with EX units so don't be afraid to invest in him so close to anniversary.

Rhaldor got High base HP and atk as well as good agi

His new Main Job Pugilist offers a teleport, a low range human killer skill and a skill that gets more damage if he got hit more than 5 times, as well as a max hp/def buff for him self and a aoe strike atk/defpen for self buff. His kit is mostly Melee and either single target or very low area which makes it hard for him to be used effective.

His Pugilist sub offers a small self heal and a low range atk break that looses effectiveness if he got hit more than 5 times. This sub is very weak and only for Content like Porcelain tower useful since it got a selfheal.

Paladin sub offers the most useful additions to his kit, a physical barrier, a second damage type as well as taunting blade which allows him to be able to be played as tank. recommended (if not used as main tank disable taunting blade)

Thief sub gives him the option to be played for Steal time, but other units do the job better than him.

His Limit got decent range, single target and reduces strike res, its fine for him and gives him more synergy with other fist units (if there were any)

His main Issue is his very limited range and AP sustain. He is also weak to magic damage.

He can be played in Bruiser combs or as Tank in most hybrid combs. His limited range and no aoe make him bad for PvE aswell, but hes still usable in most Content.

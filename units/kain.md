Pros: He is a very strong dps, and gets high def numbers for being a main attacker. He got confusion and a skill reducing incoming healing for enemys. aswell as Immortal spirit from Paladin preventing death once. 

Cons: He got a base res of 5 against most attack types and negative 10 magic res. and his def pen and pierce res reduction are fairly weak compared to most other dps.

\
Elsirelle is here to debut the new job Nightblade. It's a Slash based job that seeks to support and disrupt so don't expect her to do the damage of Ruin Sterne but that of Duane instead.\
\
To disrupt she has the cheap and 3 squares ranged "Stun Blade" that like the title says has a chance of Stunning units. At the moment no unit resists Stun so this can be very valuable.\
\
"Maiming Slash", a 3 squares ranged cross AoE that reduces healing power by 40, making it easier to hit a healer with allies and thus reducing their chances of out healing your damage.\
\
To support she has "Double Resist" a cross AoE that raises Pierce/Missile resist by 25% for 3 turns (complimenting her natural high resists to both) and another cross AoE "Concentration" that raises Slash ATK by 40 to allies and 20 DEF Pen for herself.\
\
A skill she should use often is the 3 hit (enough to break barriers) move "Drain Rush" that compensates the short 2 squares range with cheap cost and a 30% of the damage drain.\
\
Her hardest hitting move, a body contact AoE "Spin Slash", is sadly available through subbing Nightblade which you might not want to do.
You'll want her "Nighblade Mastery" passive raising ATK by 30% and ACC by 25 but decreasing Evade (not an issue) by 10. This boost to ACC combined with that of her Master Ability make her the highest ACC UR Unit in the game at this moment, however she is not ideal to be a primary Evade hunter on auto content due to the RNG's unreliability and the fact that that both Vinera and Ruin Sterne resist her attack types while she doesn't resist theirs. You can stil try pairing her with your Evade buster unit but even then you'll want to add ACC through equippables.\
\
The Spellblade subjob gives her "Magic Resist" and "Magic Barrier" both excellent choices to beef up her neutral stance against Magic.\
"Taunting Spell" is here too but unless you don't have an alternative or are making her into a super speficic Missile/Pierce tank don't be enchanted by this.\
Dual Gunner makes her damage output more versatile and with better reach. She has all the job's attack moves except for "Quadruple Shot". "Smokescreen" opens up her path to Evade to be considered when Robb gets EX and his card releases.
Using the "Tune Up" AGI + DEF Pen passive that comes with it should also be a priority.\
\
"Goodnight Rumble" is her limit that has the same range of "Maiming Slash" and decreases AP consumption by 40 when maxed. It's yet another limit I'd rather have off unless maxed because you'll be spending a lot of AP when you have a similar skill that greatly disrupts a battle instead of a selfish solo buff.\
\
Her TMR is the accessory "Heart-Shaped Hairpin" (HP 252, SPR 10, ACC 12) with one cast of a body contact AoE to buff ACC for allies by 30 at max. Can be useful in Class Match Quicken strategies but don't go with just this there or even GW and expect to hit at 100%.\
\
Synergizing with Light units and cards should be the number one priority of anyone who wants to pull her because that's where she'll shine the most. Cards like Scion of House Beoulve, Scions of Darkness, Iron Giant, and Robb's card will help her a lot. Having access to two Chain moves will make Light teams with her around more dangerous if you know how to build a team to chain on auto content.\
\
Perhaps you can sleep on Elsirelle and take a shot of energy with Garvall instead.

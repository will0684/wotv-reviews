Don't let the MR rarity fool you into thinking Creysse is useless. She's very close to Frederika in stats losing out on AGI and DEX but with the potential of reaching higher ATK thanks to the Viking Lore passive. She also reaches the same Range of 3 with Passives, 4 with buff that Frederika can.\
\
Of course most here will have a maxed Frederika by now but remember Creysse is free to max and a great addition to diversify your box and help out in the tower. I personally use all Missile teams to clear the lower floors on auto. She'll also bring Slash attacks to give you more options for Missile resistant enemies.\
\
Creysse's weakness is a lack of a good range AoE damage move. She has Sidewinder that can hit more than one unit in a row but thats because of Piercing type and not a true AoE. She also doesn't have a 100% hit move so keep that in mind.\
\
Having the ally buffs for Water makes her a great choice for Water parties where she can be a cheaper alternative to Winter Viktora or even join her for some Water Missile chains. A party of Creysse, Winter Viktora, and Tidus will get some respectable HP and Water Atk buffs. If you're on the Water course do not miss her.\
\
Her TMR is a Gun (HP 107    ATK 106    ACC 12) that's fine to use for tower if you don't have enough guns to go around but you'll want Ras Algheti for GW. It reduces Hate at battle start by 6 which can also help out a bit in tower but pretty negligible in PVP content.

Ellshra got very low HP, very high mag and decent agi.\
\
Time Mage main offers access to Comet and Meteor as strong none elemental atk, as well as Quicken.\
\
Time mage sub only really offers Haste or maybe transposition for manual play, might have some use depending on usage.\
\
Rune Knight sub gives her access to two hard hitting slash atk, a magic lifedrain that gives her a mag buff for one turn and a 3 turn mag buff that reduces her own hp. This is her best sub if you plan to play her as DPS.\
\
White Mage sub offers Protect/Shell to support her allies and Curada/Curaga for some healing. The best option if played as Support\
\
Her big problem is her terrible base HP and her base res, she dies to almost everything in one hit and rune knights skills reducing her own HP doesnt improve that.\
\
She can be played for quicken in Live PvP, as Healer Support with White Mage or as DPS with Rune Knight. She doesnt offer anything special for most PvE Content.\
\
She is a very valuable MR if you happen to get her.

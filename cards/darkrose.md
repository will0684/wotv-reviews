Helena is the Second (UR) VC to give AGI as party Lead and unlike Scion of House Beoulve its not collab limited.

The bestowed effect gives accuracy for Rod wiedlding units (White mage,Black mage etc.) which is decent, better than nothing.
Base stats are insanely high magic aswell as a bit of spirit and decent hp
It also got a ability for rod wielding unit which is a typeless diamond aoe that knocks back targets and reduces area res which is a very very strong skill

Overall a very valueable Card Agi is one of the most important stats in the game, if you dont got Scions already its highly recommended, its extremly powerful in Live PvP, any PvE, aswell as auto PvP

Global Buff: Agi for Helena leonis, whatever she got a bad kit and a bit of agi doesnt make her usable

JP Buff: Accuracy for Dark units, which is never bad helps people with low base dex/luck to hit more often.

With Attack res as party lead its the MR version of Odin. It gives Evasion as bestowed effect and low hp, okay atk and magic and even some agi as base stats.

Since Odin is free to max its fairly niche and evasion as bestowed doesnt synergize with the party lead since if you evade you dont need damage reduction.

JP Buff: Evasion for Light units, its not that great since Robbs card will get the same effect with better Values as a better card for light teams.

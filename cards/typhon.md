Its gives decent HP, high Mag and a bit of Luck as base stats.
The Party Lead gives Magic atk and Accuracy.
The Bestowed effect gives Luck as well as a limited to Wind Mag% boost.

Global Buff: Bestowed magic res pen and evasion for wind Mace units = Halloween Leela and Cadia, super broken for Leela.

JP Buff: Wind res for Wind units, kinda w/e

without the Wind specific bonus its a decent Card, but Troussan is better, if you use a Wind Unit especially Leela this Card gets way better than Troussan. A very strong Card overall and almost must have for anyone with Halloween Little Leela.
